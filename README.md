# NSW_bushfire_mapping
Mapping of 2019 NSW Bushfire season using firesnearme feed and freely avaliable data  

firesnearme_gis.R is a quick script to download the fires near me data and plot it in leaflet with or without your own personal data.  

firesmapping_6_12_19.R is me screwing around with mapping.
